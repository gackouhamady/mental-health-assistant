##  Project Goal

This project aims to develop a virtual assistant capable of engaging empathetically and helpfully with users seeking support in mental health. The assistant leverages Transformer-based language models (like GPT-2, BERT, T5) and is fine-tuned specifically on data related to emotional well-being, stress management, and active listening.

##  Project Steps

### 1. Model Exploration

* Compare models: GPT-2, DistilGPT-2, BERT, T5
* Analyze their performance for tasks like conversation, classification, and emotion detection

### 2. Data Preparation

* Collect dialogues related to mental health (e.g., EmpatheticDialogues)
* Clean, tokenize, and format the data

### 3. Fine-tuning on CPU

* Choose a lightweight model (DistilGPT-2)
* Train using `transformers.Trainer`
* Adjust hyperparameters to fit CPU constraints (8 GB RAM)

### 4. CPU Optimization

* Reduced batch size (e.g., 2)
* Gradient accumulation to simulate larger batches
* Split training into multiple sessions if needed

### 5. Deployment

* User interface with **Gradio**
* Interactive chatbot generating empathetic responses

### 6. Validation

* Test response quality (empathy, usefulness, non-judgment)
* Gather user feedback for continuous improvement

##  Technologies Used

* Python
* Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets
* Gradio for the web interface
* CPU with 8 GB RAM (training optimized accordingly)

##  Next Steps

* Finalize data collection and cleaning
* Start fine-tuning the base model
* Prototype the Gradio interface

##  Ethical Note

This project aims for supportive, non-medical use. The assistant does not replace a mental health professional. In cases of acute distress, please contact a helpline or a qualified professional.
